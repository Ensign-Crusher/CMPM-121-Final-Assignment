Tasks completed: (all)
	Model/rig/animate main character
	Scene Changes
	Populate levels

Tasks not completed:
	None for this week

Unexpected tasks:
	Fade into next level - because it looks lazy otherwise
	Create animations/prefabs folder and organize things into that
	Managing Lighting
	Creating more categories for items
	Assign score values to different-sized objects (something that I was supposed to save for next week - turns out it's real important for testing)

Video note: There's still clipping with the camera. Also there's odd light issues where some lights shut on or off. Might be more clipping issues with the camera. Right now I'm going to pass it off as a run-down store.

Bug note: (To be fixed next week) You'll see some collider errors at the end of the video. Some items I brought in are not working properly...but it's an art thing since some of the objects are made up of smaller objects and will be fixed once I touch up some of the art assets.

Side note: Technically I didn't model a new character for this week...but I did re-rig/animate it. That should count, right? The character also doesn't rotate with the ball...a task for next week.
