Video note: Camera clipping never got fixed. Quite frankly, I'm too lazy to do it.

Note: For a non-programmer, this was a fun little project.

Note 3: pause menu was inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JivuXdrIHK0

Note 4: Music was taken from youtube. Skybox from Unity Asset Store. Pick up noise was actually recorded by a housemate with their mouth.
